# The Movie Zone
(I bet everyone makes that pun..)

An App for displaying "Now Showing Movies", build with Vue, Vuex.

With Help from Vue-cli, Bootstrap.

### My Pre-Dev Assumptions

I'm going to try to test as much as I can, and TDD (which is a bit out of my comfort zone) as much as possible within the time constraints (I only had 24 hrs üïê‚ö° free at the weekend).

I'm envisage the app to be made up of a main user view with filters, and a Movie List component and a rating slider.

I'm going hit the API to get Movies and Genres and then dedupe the Genres.
