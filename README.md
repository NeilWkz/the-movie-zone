# The Movie Zone
(I bet everyone makes that pun..)

An App for displaying "Now Showing Movies", build with Vue, Vuex.

With Help from Vue-cli, Bootstrap.

### My Pre-Dev Assumptions

I'm going to try to test as much as I can, and TDD as much as possible (which is a bit out of my comfort zone as I usually test post-hoc) within the time constraints (I only had 24 hrs üïê‚ö° free at the weekend plus an hour here and there in the evenings).

I'm envisaging the app to be made up of a main user view with filters, and a Movie List component and a rating slider.

I'm going hit the API to get Movies and Genres and then dedupe the Genres.

### Retrospective Mea Culpa

The requirements are fullfilled, but at that velocity TDD went out of the window around the 10 hours mark. I like to say that all success is ultimately a by-product of a greater failure, but this is my failure as I was overambitious within the time I had available. 

If I had more time available I would have wanted to:

#### Further Dev
- componentise the controls
- written more complete unit tests for the presentational components
- written an end to end test
- Used modernizer to support non-modern browsers
- implemented src set & lazy-loaded the images

#### UX enhancements
- Improve the Mobile Experience, with a reset filters button
- Add more information to the card
- Add a slide out pane with full information about the movie
