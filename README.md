# The Movie Zone
(I bet everyone makes that pun..)

An App for displaying "Now Showing Movies", build with Vue, Vuex.

With Help from Vue-cli, Bootstrap.

### My Pre-Dev Assumptions

I'm going to try to test as much as I can, and TDD (which is a bit out of my comfort zone) as much as possible within the time constraints (I only had 24 hrs üïê‚ö° free at the weekend).

I'm envisaging the app to be made up of a main user view with filters, and a Movie List component and a rating slider.

I'm going hit the API to get Movies and Genres and then dedupe the Genres.

### Retrospective Mea Culpa

The requirements are fullfilled, but at that velocity TDD went out of the window around the 10 hours mark. I like to say that all success is ultimately a by-product of a greater failure, but this is my failure as I was overambitious within the time I had available. I refactored around hour 16 which made a lot of my original tests fail, and I did not have the time to rewrite them in line with the refactor. The UX is missing some basic requirements e.g: loading indicators, filter transitions, a better filtering layout for mobile and a fine style pass to make it a bit less ugly.
